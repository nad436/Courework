This C++ program implements a Battleship puzzle generator and solver with customizable board sizes (5x5 to 10x10) and fleet configurations. It features automatic ship placement using a backtracking algorithm with randomization, generates nonogram-style hints for empty cell sequences, and offers two display modes (hidden ships for puzzles and revealed ships for solutions). The implementation includes core classes for ships, board management, and game logic while following standard Battleship rules (non-touching ships). The program provides both manual setup options and a predefined 8x8 configuration with a typical fleet.
